Test::Effects::ONLY - Lexically set Test::Effects verbosity


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Test::Effects::ONLY version 0.000001


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    {
        use Test::Effects::ONLY;
        # Test::Effects defaults to only testing specified effects in this scope

        {
            no Test::Effects::ONLY;
            # Test::Effects defaults to testing all effects in this scope
        }

        # Test::Effects still only testing specified effects here

    }
    # Test::Effects reverts to original behaviour here


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Using this module changes the default behaviour of Test::Effects's
C<effects_ok()> test.

Normally this test tests all side-effects, even those unspecified
(unless explicitly told otherwise via the use of C<ONLY()>). If this
module is used in a code block, C<effects_ok()> defaults to only running
specified tests for the remainder of that block's lexical scope.

Note, however, that an explicit C<< ONLY => $boolean >> option in
any call to C<<effects_ok()> overrides this lexical default.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 C<use Test::Effects::ONLY;>

C<effects_ok> defaults to only runnign specified test within the rest of
the current lexical scope.


=head2 C<no Test::Effects::ONLY;>

C<effects_ok> defaults to running all tests (including unspecified ones)
within the rest of the current lexical scope.


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

None.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
