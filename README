Test::Effects version 0.001000

Test::Effects provides a single exported subroutine: effects_ok();

This sub expects a code block to execute, followed by a hash that
specifies which side-effects of that code shoudl be tested (and how).
The module can test everything that Test::Trap does, as well as
timing information, but provides a much more convenient interface
for specifying those tests.
